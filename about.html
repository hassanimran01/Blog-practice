    <h1>About our Electric Bikes Blog</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our blog! I’m Average Joe Cyclist, and I love electric bikes! I have written a book about how to choose the best electric bike. This Electric Bikes Blog features product reviews, news, and advice. I also have a blog about all aspects of cycling – my Average Joe Cyclist Blog.</p>

        Hi! I’m Maggie (aka Mrs. Average Joe Cyclist). Together Joe and I have done a lot of cycling, and Joe has passed on his love of electric bikes to me. I love my electric bike, and I share my passion for electric bikes on this blog.</BLOckquote>

        As gas prices and obesity skyrocket, more and more people are looking for healthy, affordable alternatives for their transport needs – and many of them are seeing the exciting potential of electric bikes. Electric bikes make cycling possible for average people – not just the lean, young, and fit minority. As a result, they offer almost everyone a way to travel without gas and get fit at the same time – at a cost that is much, much cheaper than cars. No wonder the popularity of electric bikes is soaring!
