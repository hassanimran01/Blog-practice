    <h1>What is an electric bike?</h1>
    <P>Simply put, e-bikes are bicycles that integrate an electric motor and battery that add a power boost to your own pedalling. Though they have motors, e-bikes are more similar to standard bikes than they are to mopeds or motorcycles.</P> 
    <P>These days virtually all e-bike systems offer multiple levels of powered assistance, so you can decide how much help you want to get from the motor. The great thing about e-bikes is that they allow you to choose just how easy or challenging your ride is going to be.</P>
    <P>In fact, in most countries, for a product to be defined as an e-bike, it must use a pedal assist system rather than the throttle you’d find on a moped or motorcycle. Pedal assist means the bike’s motor only engages when you’re pedalling. While you’re getting a helpful push from the motor, you’re still putting in work to ride.</P>
